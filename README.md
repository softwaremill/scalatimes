Newsletters Archive via Mailchimp API
===================

You can see example on [Scala Times](http://www.scalatimes.com/) - Weekly Scala Newspaper.


## Overview

This app is built on the top of [MailChimp API v2.0 NodeJs Example Application](https://github.com/mailchimp/mcapi2-node-examples).

### Analytics

Here is [the link](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#report/defaultid/a11235106w117557468p123015903/) where you can check GA for the site.

### TeamCity CI

Continuous Integration for the site is [here](https://teamcity.internal.sml.io/project.html?projectId=ScalatimesCom&tab=projectOverview).

## Running project for the first time

### NodeJS

Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) or check, if you have it installed.
To check, if it's installed, run command `node -v` in console. 
If you see version - than you have it installed. 

If not - go to [http://nodejs.org/](nodejs.org) and install it from there.


### Install dependencies

In console navigate to project's folder and run 

```
  npm install
```

This will install all required dependencies for this project (Express, Pug, Mailchimp API, Cheerio, Underscore).


### Run app

#### Mailchimp setup
Navigate to `routes/archive.js` file and update Mailchimp API key and List ID.
You need a Mailchimp API key and List ID. If you have a user account connected to the SoftwareMill account, use following
instructions to retrieve this data:  
[Here](http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/management/about-api-keys) you can find information on how to find your Mailchimp API key.
[Here](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/managing-subscribers/find-your-list-id) you can find information on how to find List ID.

#### Amazon CloudSearch setup
The application allows users to search links based on some text. It does so by using AWS Cloud Search underneath. In order
for this to work you must have AWS account with
[Search Domain created there](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/latest/developerguide/creating-domains.html).
Each Search Domain is given unique endpoint that can be used to issue search queries.
[More details here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/latest/developerguide/search-api.html).

Example value of `AWS_CS_QUERY_URL` =
`http://search-movies-rr2f34ofg56xneuemujamut52i.us-east-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com/2013-01-01/search`

Current implementation of search sorts results based on custom expression named `custom_score`. This Expression is defined
as `_score*(1-min(0.1*(_time-date)/31556926000,0.5))`. So for a 1 year old link we decrease build-in `_score` by 10%, 
for 2 years old by 20%, and so on. At most we reduce the original `_score` by 50% so it doesn't matter if link is 5 years
old or 7 years old. Expressions can be easily managed through CloudSearch Dashboard.

#### When you are all set up
After all configuration is done just run:

```
  CACHE_PATH=/tmp MAILCHIMP_API_KEY={YOUR_API_KEY} MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID={YOUR_LIST_ID} AWS_CS_QUERY_URL={AWS_CS_URL}  node app.js
```

or for Windows run like this

```
  $env:CACHE_PATH="{some path}"
  $env:MAILCHIMP_API_KEY="{key}"
  $env:MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID="{list_id}"
  $env:AWS_CS_QUERY_URL="{aws_cloud_serach_url}"

  node app.js
```

Wait couple of seconds, while you see

```
  campaignsCache is ready
```
in console.

Novigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

You should have the latest issue on index page, and archive (last 100 issues) on `http://localhost:3000/archive` page. 

### Live deployment
The production deployment exposed on https://scalatimes.com is automatically deployed from the `master` branch.

### Disk cache

The app tries to load campaigns from local cache directory specified by `CACHE_PATH`. This directory can be purged to force reload from MailChimp API.

### Fix archive page

To make your archive page properly show excerpts of every newsletter, you need to update function `getCampaignExcerpts()` in `routes/archive.js`.
This function gets HTML of every campaign and finds important information in that HTML.
